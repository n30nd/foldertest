[2024-11-18 17:24:43,867][flwr][ERROR] - Your simulation crashed :(. This could be because of several reasons.The most common are: 
	 > Your system couldn't fit a single VirtualClient: try lowering `client_resources`.
	 > All the actors in your pool crashed. This could be because: 
		 - You clients hit an out-of-memory (OOM) error and actors couldn't recover from it. Try launching your simulation with more generous `client_resources` setting (i.e. it seems {'num_cpus': 6, 'num_gpus': 0.5} is not enough for your workload). Use fewer concurrent actors. 
		 - You were running a multi-node simulation and all worker nodes disconnected. The head node might still be alive but cannot accommodate any actor with resources: {'num_cpus': 6, 'num_gpus': 0.5}.
